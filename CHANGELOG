CHANGELOG

0.2 - Michael Sparks <sparks.m@gmail.com> 23 Sept 2012

    The codebase now supports touchtag readers as well as tikitag
    readers. 

    This forces two changes:

       * The name needs to change to rfidtag rather than tiki (for hopefully
         obvious reasons)
       * The examples need to change to match this obviously. (the kamaelia one
         has been simplified and made to work)
       * The touchatag readers have a different USB ID, and so that needs 
         including.

0.1 - Michael Sparks <sparks.m@gmail.com> 23 Sept 2012

    Transformed to use distutils for installation. Initial release.
